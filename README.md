# TaskManagement
This project was my starting point to acquire the basics of React.

This application allows the user to manage tasks.

I put into practice concepts such as component, props, useState, hooks, styles, useContext, useEffect, in addition to using other tools such as create-react-app, vitejs, tailwindcss, react-icons and other npm (Nodejs) libraries.
